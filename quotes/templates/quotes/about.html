    <h2>Malcolm X - A Short Biography</h2>
    <p>Malcolm X (1925–1965) was a prominent African American leader in the civil rights movement, minister, and advocate for Black nationalism. He is widely known for his unapologetic stance on Black empowerment, his role within the Nation of Islam, and his eventual break from the group. Malcolm X's life was marked by a dramatic transformation, from a troubled youth to a powerful voice for justice.</p>

    <p>He is remembered for his calls to defend oneself “by any means necessary,” a radical departure from the nonviolent approach of leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. In his later years, Malcolm X converted to mainstream Islam and distanced himself from the Nation of Islam, condemning its leader, Elijah Muhammad, whom he had once followed.</p>

    <p>Malcolm X's life came to a tragic end when he was assassinated on February 21, 1965, while giving a speech at the Audubon Ballroom in New York City. His legacy as a trailblazer in the struggle for racial justice remains influential to this day.</p>
